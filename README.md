# Setvi Technical Task

This repository is the result of my independent project for SETVI.

## What can you find here
* Quick summary about this repo: I spent 2 days on the realization and setting up this project. The JavaScript programming language was used to write the code. The URL for the endpoint I got for SETVI, and I had no intention of harming the company itself, but only to increase and improve my skills.
* Folder structure: inside the Cypress folder, there is an e2e folder containing a test file. The main class is located in the modules folder, which is also inside the cypress folder, and this class contains all the methods..
* Side information: To use the application in a special environment, the author accepts no responsibility if you cause damage to third parties
* Detailed bug report [5 positive, 5 negative](https://github.com/pavlovic-bojan/SetviTechnicalTask/blob/main/BUG_REPORT/BUG_REPORT.md)

## Execution of tests in CI/CD using GitHub Actions
Go to [Actions](https://github.com/pavlovic-bojan/SetviTechnicalTask/actions), then choose on the left side [Setvi Technical Task](https://github.com/pavlovic-bojan/SetviTechnicalTask/actions/workflows/main.yml), then on the right side click on Run workflow in the text box, insert branches if not want to run from the main branch, and then click on the  green button Run workflow.

[The results of the last test execution are visible at this link](https://pavlovic-bojan.github.io/SetviTechnicalTask/)
> In the meantime, if the owners changed something on the endpoint and some tests failed, maybe all the tests failed due to changes in the endpoint itself. I don't have any influence, nor is the company obliged to let me know about changes, because this project is only a demo project.
